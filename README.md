**Introduction**

This project focuses on creation of a neural network based approach for generating and tracing red color patterns using a robotic manipulator. The robotic manipulator is a TATA TAL Brabo (5-DOF Robot) which has been interfaced with MATLAB and uses the ActiveX protocol for communication.
